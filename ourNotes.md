## Notes

Most Nebulae are incredibly large, with some being hundreds of light years in diameter

1 Light-year = 9,460,730,472,580.8 kms

The Orion Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky would occupy an area twice the diameter of the full Moon

a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms.
